# Saudi America

Saudi America, a burgeoning brokerage startup, is dedicated to bridging the gap between Middle Eastern and American markets, catering to the needs of everyday retail investors. With a substantial clientele of approximately 100,000 users, the platform facilitates an impressive $5,000,000,000 USD in trades each month. To efficiently manage and streamline their operations, Saudi America requires a robust database-backed system. This system would play a pivotal role in tracking and organizing a multitude of crucial data points, including but not limited to orders, securities, positions, and investor information. The database will enable seamless transaction tracking, portfolio management, and client engagement, providing the scalability needed to accommodate the dynamic nature of a rapidly growing user base and transaction volume.
